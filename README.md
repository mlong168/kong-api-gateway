## Orchestrated Builds with Docker and Docker-Compose

Build orchestration allows complicated multi-faceted and highly-available distributed systems to be deployed to a high standard and easily packaged and deployed to test/prod environments, resulting in the ability to rapidly, reliably and repeatedly push out enhancements and bug fixes to customers at low risk and with minimal manual overhead. Hereâ€™s how it would look. 

## The system was built using the following technologies:
- Docker
- Docker-machine
- Docker-compose
- Docker-swarm -- TBD
- Kong-API-Gateway-with-oAuth2-config-scripts
- Kong-UI
- Multi-Datacenter-Four-NodeDistributed Cassandra Cluster
1. Systems not included but ready for build:
  * API-EndPoints
  * MySQL-NDB
